# ToDo_List
The objective of this assignment is to create a basic RESTful API that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a to-do list. The API will allow clients (such as web or mobile applications) to interact with a to-do list database, where they can add tasks, retrieve tasks, update task details, and delete tasks. 
To-Do List API (Backend): This is a RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) that allows users to manage their tasks (to-dos). The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting to-do tasks.

To-Do List Web Application (Frontend): A simple web interface that interacts with the backend API to allow users to view and manage their to-do tasks through a user-friendly interface.
Backend: To-Do List API
The backend API provides the following functionalities:

Create a Task: Users can add a new task to their to-do list.
Read Tasks: Users can view the list of all tasks.
Update a Task: Users can update an existing task, such as marking it as completed.
Delete a Task: Users can remove a task from their list.
Requirements Setup for Backend
Python: Python 3.12 or above (You are using Python 3.12).
Django: Django 4.x (Ensure itâ€™s installed in your virtual environment).
Django REST Framework (DRF): A framework for building APIs with Django.
SQLite Database: Default database used for Django projects, though this can be changed.
