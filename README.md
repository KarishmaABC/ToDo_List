# ToDo_List
The objective of this assignment is to create a basic RESTful API that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a to-do list. The API will allow clients (such as web or mobile applications) to interact with a to-do list database, where they can add tasks, retrieve tasks, update task details, and delete tasks.
